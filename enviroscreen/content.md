### Current Content

Draft versions of Enviroscreen score as of 2021-12-06

#### Data for all map features

The tables visualized here will function similarly to those in the shiny application.
**note: the tremendous width of the table is something that will be addressed.**
I'm experimenting with the download functionality and I can provide the original data file if needed.

## Maps
Each map has some unique elements to it to provide a variety of options for discussion.

#### County

[map](https://geospatialcentroid.github.io/enviroscreen/countyMap.html)

- divergent color scale
- includes oil, rural, and coal communities layers **these are not included in other maps
- darker outline highlighting

#### Census Tract  

[map](https://geospatialcentroid.github.io/enviroscreen/censusTractMap.html)

- single color scale; 9 color groups

#### Census Block Groups

[map](https://geospatialcentroid.github.io/enviroscreen/censusBlockGroupMap.html)

- single color scale; 5 groups
- showcases indicator (ozone) rather then enviroscreen score as it is a more consistent distribution.
