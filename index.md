## Welcome to the Centroid Share Site

This resource is available to host temporary content so we don't have to upload and email files to project partners, so they can download and view them. Instead we will upload here and share a link. I expect the primary use case of this resources will be htmls derived from rmd workflows.

Please direct any questions to dan at carverd@colostate.edu

### Enviroscreen

[map example](https://geospatialcentroid.github.io/docs/mapExample.html)

The primary map elements is the cholopleth. It's important that the popup remains accessible.

I need to figure out a means showing the other information without loosing access to the cholopleth content.

any recommendations or thoughts are appreciated.
