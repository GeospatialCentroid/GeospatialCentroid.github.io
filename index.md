### Enviroscreen

**Question - 2021-11-11**

In the following map, [map example](https://geospatialcentroid.github.io/docs/mapExample.html), how can we visualize both the primary map element (cholopleth) and the reference information(oil and gas communities...)

We need to maintain access to the popup information on the cholopleth object...so layering options are a bit tricky.
Any recommendations or thoughts are appreciated.
Dan
