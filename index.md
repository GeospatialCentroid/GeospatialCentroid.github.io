## Welcome to the Centroid Share Site

This resource is available to host temporary content so we don't have to upload and email files to project partners, so they can download and view them. Instead we will upload here and share a link. I expect the primary use case of this resources will be htmls derived from rmd workflows.

Please direct any questions to dan at carverd@colostate.edu

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/GeospatialCentroid/GeospatialCentroid.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
